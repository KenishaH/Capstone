<p> Welcome to 24hrs paws Playhosue . As founder of this webiste my name is Ke'Nisha Hope. I have my degree from Harris-Stowe State University . Recently I have adpoted a dog by the name of Max. With this big change in my life I always have to take upon another respsonbility.I am a dog owner who has a love for tarveling.I have a care for dogs and the wellbeing of their saftey. One common problem I often run into when wanting to travel is finding a dog siiter for long periods of times. This had lead me to create a network to help other find effiecent sitters for days or even a day.  </p>
