      Recently I have adpoted a dog by the name of Max. With this big change in
      my life I always have to take upon another respsonbility.I am a dog owner
      who has a love for tarveling.I have a care for dogs and the wellbeing of
      their saftey. One common problem I often run into when wanting to travel
      is finding a dog siiter for long periods of times. This had lead me to
      create a network to help other find effiecent sitters for days or even a
      day.
